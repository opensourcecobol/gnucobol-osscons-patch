File: gnucobol.info,  Node: Hello world!,  Up: Getting started

1.1 Hello, world!
=================

This is a sample program that displays "Hello, world!":

     ---- hello.cob -------------------------
           * Sample COBOL program
            IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
            PROGRAM-ID. hello.
            PROCEDURE DIVISION.
            DISPLAY "Hello, world!".
            STOP RUN.
     ----------------------------------------


   The compiler, 'cobc', is executed as follows:

     $ cobc -x hello.cob
     $ ./hello
     Hello, world!


   The executable file name ('hello' in this case) is determined by
removing the extension from the source file name.


   You can specify the executable file name by specifying the compiler
option '-o' as follows:

     $ cobc -x -o hello-world hello.cob
     $ ./hello-world
     Hello, world!


   The program can be written in a more modern style, with free format
code, inline comments, the 'GOBACK' verb and an optional 'END-DISPLAY'
terminator:

     ---- hellonew.cob ----------------
     *> Sample GnuCOBOL program
     identification division.
     program-id. hellonew.
     procedure division.
     display
        "Hello, new world!"
     end-display
     goback.
     ----------------------------------

   To compile free-format code, you must use the compiler option
'-free'.

     $ cobc -x -free hellonew.cob
     $ ./hellonew
     Hello, new world!

2.1.1 Help options
------------------

The following switches display information about the compiler:

'--help, -h'
     Display help screen (*note Appendix A::).  No further actions will
     be taken.

'--version'
     Display compiler version, author package date and executable build
     date.  '-V' will also display version.  No further actions will be
     taken.

'--info'
     Display build information along with the default and current
     compiler configurations.  No further actions will be taken except
     for further display options.

'--version, -v'
     Verbosely display the programs invoked during compilation and
     additional diagnostics.  Use multiple times to increase the
     verbosity.

'--list-reserved'
     Display reserved words (*note Appendix B::).  A Yes/No output shows
     if the word is supported (1), context sensitive and its aliases.
     The given options for reserved words specified for example by
     option '-std=DIALECT' will be taken into account.  No further
     actions will be taken except for further display options.

'--list-intrinsics'
     Display intrinsic functions (*note Appendix C::).  A Y/N field
     shows if the function is implemented.  No further actions will be
     taken except for further display options.

'--list-system'
     Display system routines (*note Appendix D::).  No further actions
     will be taken except for further display options.

'--list-mnemonics'
     Display mnemonic names (*note Appendix E::).  No further actions
     will be taken except for further display options.

   (1) Support may be partial or complete.


File: gnucobol.info,  Node: Build target,  Next: Source format,  Prev: Help options,  Up: Compiler options

2.1.2 Build target
------------------

The compiler 'cobc' treats files like '*.cob', '*.cbl' as COBOL source
code, '*.c' as C source code, '*.o' as object code, '*.i' as
preprocessed code and '*.so' as dynamic modules and knows how to handle
such files in the generation, compilation, and linking steps.

   The special input name '-' takes input from 'stdin' which is assumed
to be COBOL source, and uses a default output name of 'a.out' (or
'a.so/c/o/i', selected as appropriate) for the build type.

   By default, the compiler builds a dynamically loadable module.

   The following options specify the target type produced by the
compiler:

'-E'
     Preprocess only: compiler directives are executed, comment lines
     are removed and 'COPY' statements are expanded.  The output is
     saved in file '*.i'.

'-C'
     Translation only.  COBOL source files are translated into C files.
     The output is saved in file '*.c'.

'-S'
     Compile only.  Translated C files are compiled by the C compiler to
     assembler code.  The output is saved in file '*.s'.

'-c'
     Compile and assemble.  This is equivalent to 'cc -c'.  The output
     is saved in file '*.o'.

'-m'
     Compile, assemble, and build a dynamically loadable module (i.e., a
     shared library).  The output is saved in file '*.so'.  (1)  This is
     the default behaviour.

'-b'
     Compile, assemble, and combine all input files into a single
     dynamically loadable module.  Unless '-o' is also used, the output
     is saved using the first filename as '*.so'.

'-x'
     Include the main function in the output, creating an executable
     image.  The main entry point being the first program in the file.

     This option takes effect at the translation stage.  If you give
     this option with '-C', you will see the main function at the end of
     the generated C file.

'-j, -job, -j=ARGS, -job=ARGS'
     Run job after compilation.  Either from executable with '-x', or
     with 'cobcrun' when compiling a module.  Optional arguments ARGS,
     if given, are passed to the program or module command line.

'-I DIRECTORY'
     Add DIRECTORY to copy/include search path.

'-L DIRECTORY'
     Add DIRECTORY to library search path.

'-l LIB'
     Link the library LIB.

'-D DEFINE'
     Pass DEFINE to the COBOL compiler.

'-o FILE'
     Place the output into FILE.

   (1) The extension varies depending on your host.


File: gnucobol.info,  Node: Source format,  Next: Warning options,  Prev: Build target,  Up: Compiler options

2.1.3 Source format
-------------------

GnuCOBOL supports both fixed and free source format.  The default format
is the fixed format.  This can be overridden either by the '>>SOURCE
[FORMAT] [IS] {FIXED|FREE}' directive, or by one of the following
options:

'-free, -F'
     Free format.  The program-text area starts in column 1 and
     continues till the end of line (effectively 255 characters in
     GnuCOBOL).

'-fixed'
     Fixed format.  Source code is divided into: columns 1-6, the
     sequence number area; column 7, the indicator area; columns 8-72,
     the program-text area; and columns 72-80 as the reference area.(1)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Historically, fixed format was based on 80-character punch cards.


File: gnucobol.info,  Node: Warning options,  Next: Configuration options,  Prev: Source format,  Up: Compiler options

2.1.4 Warning options
---------------------

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that are not
inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there may have been
an error.

   The following options do not enable specific warnings but control the
kinds of diagnostics produced by 'cobc'.

'-fsyntax-only'
     Check Check the code for syntax errors, but don’t do anything
     beyond that.

'-fmax-errors=N'
     Limits the maximum number of error messages to N, at which point
     'cobc' bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the
     source code.  If N is 0, there is no limit on the number of error
     messages produced.  If '-Wfatal-errors' is also specified, then
     '-Wfatal-errors' takes precedence over this option.

'-w'
     Inhibit all warning messages.

'-Werror'
     Make all warnings into errors.

'-Werror=WARNING'
     Make the specified WARNING into an error.  The specifier for a
     warning is appended; for example '-Werror=obsolete' turns the
     warnings controlled by '-Wobsolete' into errors.  This switch takes
     a negative form, to be used to negate '-Werror' for specific
     warnings; for example '-Wno-error=obsolete' makes '-Wobsolete'
     warnings not be errors, even when '-Werror' is in effect.

     Note that specifying '-Werror=foo' automatically implies '-Wfoo'.
     However, '-Wno-error=foo' does not imply anything.

'-Wfatal-errors'

     This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first
     error occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing
     further error messages.



   You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
''-W'', for example '-Wimplicit-define' to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning ''-Wno'' to turn off warnings; for example,
'-Wno-implicit-define'.  This manual lists only one of the two forms,
whichever is not the default.

   Some options, such as '-Wall' and '-Wextra', turn on other options,
such as '-Wtruncate'.  The combined effect of positive and negative
forms is that more specific options have priority over less specific
ones, independently of their position in the command-line.  For options
of the same specificity, the last one takes effect.

'-Wall'
     Enable all the warnings about constructions that some users
     consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
     prevent the warning).
     The list of warning flags turned on by this option is shown in
     '--help'.

'-Wextra, -W'
     Enable every possible warning that is not dialect specific.  This
     includes more information than '-Wall' would normally provide.
     (This option used to be called '-W'.  The older name is still
     supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)

'-WWARNING'
     Enable single warning WARNING.

'-Wno-WARNING'
     Disable single warning WARNING.

'-Warchaic'
     Warn if archaic features are used, such as continuation lines or
     the 'NEXT SENTENCE' statement.

'-Wcall-params'
     Warn if non-01/77-level items are used as arguments in a 'CALL'
     statement.  This is _not_ set with '-Wall'.

'-Wcolumn-overflow'
     Warn if text after column 72 in FIXED format.  This is _not_ set
     with '-Wall'.

'-Wconstant'
     Warn inconsistent constant

'-Wimplicit-define'
     Warn if implicitly defined data items are used.

'-Wlinkage'
     Warn dangling 'LINKAGE' items.  This is _not_ set with '-Wall'.

'-Wobsolete'
     Warn if obsolete features are used.

'-Wparentheses'
     Warn about any lack of parentheses around 'AND' within 'OR'.

'-Wredefinition'
     Warn about incompatible redefinitions of data items.

'-Wstrict-typing'
     Warn about type mismatch strictly.

'-Wterminator'
     Warn about the lack of scope terminator END-XXX. This is _not_ set
     with '-Wall'.

'-Wtruncate'
     Warn on possible field truncation.  This is _not_ set with '-Wall'.

'-Wunreachable'
     Warn if statements are unreachable.  This is _not_ set with
     '-Wall'.

'-Wadditional'
     Enable warnings that don't have an own warning flag.


File: gnucobol.info,  Node: Configuration options,  Next: Listing options,  Prev: Warning options,  Up: Compiler options

2.1.5 Configuration options
---------------------------

The compiler uses many dialect specific options.  These may be set via a
defined dialect by '-std=', a configuration file by '-conf=' or by using
the single dialect flags directly.

   *Note Compiler Configuration: Appendix F, and 'config/*.conf'.

   Note concerning the defined dialects: The GnuCOBOL compiler tries to
limit both the feature-set and reserved words to the specified compiler
when the "strict" dialects are used.  COBOL sources compiled with these
dialects are therefore _likely_ to compile with the specified compiler
and vice versa: sources that were compiled on the specified compiler
should compile without any issues with GnuCOBOL.
With the "non-strict" dialects GnuCOBOL will activate the complete
feature-set where it doesn't directly conflict with the specified
dialect, including reserved words.  COBOL sources compiled with these
dialects therefore may work only with GnuCOBOL. COBOL sources may need a
change because of reserved words in GnuCOBOL, otherwise offending words
WORD-1 and WORD-2 may be removed by '-fno-reserved=WORD-1,WORD-1'.

   The dialects COBOL-85, X/Open COBOL, COBOL 2002 and COBOL 2014 are
always "strict".

'-std=DIALECT'
     Compiler uses the given DIALECT to determine certain compiler
     features and warnings.

'-std=default'
     GnuCOBOL dialect, supporting many of the COBOL 2002 and COBOL 2014
     features, many extensions found in other dialects and its own
     feature-set

'-std=cobol85'
     COBOL-85 without any extensions other than the amendment Intrinsic
     Function Module (1989), source compiled with this dialect is likely
     to compile with most COBOL compilers

'-std=xopen'
     X/Open COBOL (based on COBOL-85) without any vendor extensions,
     source compiled with this dialect is likely to compile with most
     COBOL compilers; will warn items that "should not be used in a
     conforming X/Open COBOL source program"

'-std=cobol2002, -std=cobol2014'
     COBOL 2002 / COBOL 2014 without any vendor extensions, use
     '-Warchaic' and '-Wobsolete' if archaic/obsolete features should be
     flagged

'-std=ibm-strict, -std=ibm'
     IBM compatible

'-std=mvs-strict, -std=mvs'
     MVS compatible

'-std=mf-strict, -std=mf'
     Micro Focus compatible

'-std=bs2000-strict, -std=bs2000'
     BS2000 compatible

'-std=acu-strict, -std=acu'
     ACUCOBOL-GT compatible

'-std=rm-strict, -std=rm'
     RM/COBOL compatible

'-std=realia-strict, -std=realia'
     CA Realia II compatible

'-freserved-words=DIALECT'
     Compiler uses the given DIALECT to determine the reserved words.

'-conf=<file>'
     User-defined dialect configuration.

   You can override each single configuration entry by using compiler
configuration options on the command line.

   Examples:

'-frelax-syntax-checks'
'-frenames-uncommon-levels=warning'
'-fnot-reserved=CHAIN,SCREEN'
'-ftab-width=4'
   *Note Compiler 'cobc' options: Appendix A.

2.1.6 Listing options
---------------------

'-t=FILE'
     Generate and place the standard print listing into 'FILE'.

'-T=FILE'
     Generate and place a wide print listing into '*FILE'.

'--tlines=LINES'
     Specify lines per page in print listing, default = 55.  Set to zero
     for no additional page breaks.

'-ftsymbols'
     Generate symbol table in listing.

'-fno-theader'
     Suppress all headers from listing while keeping page breaks.

'-fno-tmessages'
     Suppress warning and error summary from listing.

'-fno-tsource'
     Suppress actual source from listing (for example to only produce
     the cross-reference).

'-P, -PDIRECTORY, -P=FILE'
     Generate and place a preprocessed listing (old format) into
     'FILENAME.lst', 'DIRECTORY/FILENAME.lst', 'FILE'.

'-Xref'
'-X'
     Generate cross reference in the listing.

   Here is an example program listing with the options '-t -ftsymbols':

2.2 Multiple sources
====================

This section describes how to compile a program from multiple source
files.

   This section also describes how to build a shared library that can be
used by any COBOL program and how to use external libraries in COBOL
programs.

* Menu:

* Static linking::              Compiling into a single executable
* Dynamic linking::             A main program and separate modules
* Building library::            Building a shared library
* Using library::               Using external libraries


File: gnucobol.info,  Node: Static linking,  Next: Dynamic linking,  Up: Multiple sources

2.2.1 Static linking
--------------------

The easiest way of combining multiple files is to compile them into a
single executable.

   One way is to compile all the files in one command:

     $ cobc -x -o prog main.cob subr1.cob subr2.cob

   Another way is to compile each file with the option '-c', and link
them at the end.  The top-level program must be compiled with the option
'-x'.

     $ cobc -c subr1.cob
     $ cobc -c subr2.cob
     $ cobc -c -x main.cob
     $ cobc -x -o prog main.o subr1.o subr2.o

   You can link C routines as well using either method:

     $ cobc -o prog main.cob subrs.c

   or
     $ cobc -c subrs.c
     $ cobc -c -x main.cob
     $ cobc -x -o prog main.o subrs.o

   Any number of functions can be contained in a single C file.

   The linked programs will be called dynamically; that is, the symbol
will be resolved at run time.  For example, the following COBOL
statement

     CALL "subr" USING X.

   will be converted into equivalent C code like this:

     int (*func)() = cob_resolve("subr");
     if (func != NULL)
       func (X);

   With the compiler option '-fstatic-call', more efficient code will be
generated:

     subr(X);

   Please notice that this option only takes effect when the called
program name is in a literal (like 'CALL "subr"').  With a data name
(like 'CALL SUBR'), the program is still called dynamically.


File: gnucobol.info,  Node: Dynamic linking,  Next: Building library,  Prev: Static linking,  Up: Multiple sources

2.2.2 Dynamic linking
---------------------

There are two methods to achieve this: a driver program, or compiling
the main program and subprograms separately.

2.2.2.1 Driver program
......................

Compile all programs with the option '-m':
     $ cobc -m main.cob subr.cob
   This creates the shared object files 'main.so' and 'subr.so'.  (1)

   Before running the main program, install the module files in your
library directory:
     $ cp subr.so /your/cobol/lib
   Set the runtime variable 'COB_LIBRARY_PATH' to your library
directory, and run the main program:
     $ export COB_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/cobol/lib
   (_Please notice:_ You may set the variable via a runtime
configuration file, *note Runtime Configuration: Appendix H. You may
also set the variable to directly point to the directory where you
compiled the sources.)

   Now execute your program:
     $ cobcrun main

2.2.2.2 Compiling programs separately
.....................................

The main program is compiled as usual:
     $ cobc -x -o main main.cob

   Subprograms are compiled with the option '-m':
     $ cobc -m subr.cob
   This creates a module file 'subr.so'(2).

   Before running the main program, install the module files in your
library directory:
     $ cp subr.so /your/cobol/lib

   Now, set the environment variable 'COB_LIBRARY_PATH' to your library
directory, and run the main program:
     $ export COB_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/cobol/lib
     $ ./main

2.2.3 Building library
----------------------

You can build a shared library by combining multiple COBOL programs and
even C routines:

     $ cobc -c subr1.cob
     $ cobc -c subr2.cob
     $ cc -c subr3.c
     $ cc -shared -o libsubrs.so subr1.o subr2.o subr3.o


File: gnucobol.info,  Node: Using library,  Prev: Building library,  Up: Multiple sources

2.2.4 Using library
-------------------

You can use a shared library by linking it with your main program.

   Before linking the library, install it in your system library
directory:
     $ cp libsubrs.so /usr/lib
   or install it somewhere else and set 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH':
     $ cp libsubrs.so /your/cobol/lib
     $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/cobol/lib

   Then, compile the main program, linking the library as follows:
     $ cobc -x main.cob -L/your/cobol/lib -lsubrs

2.3.1 Writing Main Program in C
-------------------------------

Include 'libcob.h' in your C program and call 'cob_init' before using
any COBOL module.  Do a cleanup afterwards, either by calling
'cob_stop_run' (if your program should terminate) or by calling
'cob_tidy' (if your program should execute further on without any more
COBOL calls, calling both functions in this sequence can be done
multiple times).

     #include <libcob.h>

     int
     main (int argc, char **argv)
     {
       /* initialize your program */
       ...

       /* initialize the COBOL run-time library */
       cob_init (argc, argv);

       /* rest of your program */
       ...

       /* Clean up and terminate - This does not return */
       cob_stop_run (return_status);
     }

   You can write 'cobc_init(0, NULL);' if you do not want to pass
command line arguments to COBOL.

   You can compile your C program as follows:

     cc -c ̀cob-config --cflags̀ main.c

   The compiled object must be linked with libcob as follows:

     cc -o main main.o ̀cob-config --libs̀

2.3.2 Static linking with COBOL programs
----------------------------------------

Let's call the following COBOL module from a C program:

     ---- say.cob ---------------------------
            IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
            PROGRAM-ID. say.
            ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
            DATA DIVISION.
            LINKAGE SECTION.
            01 hello PIC X(7).
            01 world PIC X(6).
            PROCEDURE DIVISION USING hello world.
                DISPLAY hello world.
                EXIT PROGRAM.
     ----------------------------------------

   This program accepts two arguments, displays them, and exits.

   From the viewpoint of C, this is equivalent to a function having the
following prototype:

     extern int say(char *hello, char *world);

   So, your main program will look like as follows:

     ---- hello.c ---------------------------
     #include <libcob.h>

     extern int say(char *hello, char *world);

     int
     main()
     {
       int ret;
       char hello[8] = "Hello, ";
       char world[7] = "world!";

       /* initialize the COBOL run-time library */
       cob_init(0, NULL);

       /* call the static module and store its return code */
       ret = say(hello, world);

       /* shutdown the COBOL run-time library, keep program running */
       (void)cob_tidy();

       return ret;
     }
     ----------------------------------------

   Compile these programs as follows:

     $ cc -c `cob-config --cflags` hello.c
     $ cobc -c -static say.cob
     $ cobc -x -o hello hello.o say.o
     $ ./hello
     Hello, world!

2.3.3 Dynamic linking with COBOL programs
-----------------------------------------

You can find a COBOL module having a specific name by using the C
function 'cob_resolve', which takes the module name as a string and
returns a pointer to the module function.

   'cob_resolve' returns 'NULL' if there is no module.  In this case,
the function 'cob_resolve_error' returns the error message.

   Let's see an example:

     ---- hello-dynamic.c -------------------
     #include <libcob.h>

     static int (*say)(char *hello, char *world);

     int main()
     {
       int ret;
       char hello[8] = "Hello, ";
       char world[7] = "world!";

       /* initialize the COBOL run-time library */
       cob_init(0, NULL);

       /* Find the module with PROGRAM-ID "say". */
       say = cob_resolve("say");

       /* If there is no such module, show error and exit. */
       if(say == NULL) {
         fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", cob_resolve_error());
         exit(1);
       }

       /* Call the module found ... */
       ret = say(hello, world);

       /* ...and exit with the return code. */
       cob_stop_run(ret);
     }
     ----------------------------------------

   Compile these programs as follows:

     $ cc -c `cob-config --cflags` hello-dynamic.c
     $ cobc -x -o hello hello-dynamic.o
     $ cobc -m say.cob
     $ export COB_LIBRARY_PATH=.
     $ ./hello
     Hello, world!


File: gnucobol.info,  Node: Static COBOL to C,  Next: Dynamic COBOL to C,  Prev: Dynamic C to COBOL,  Up: C interface

2.3.4 Static linking with C programs
------------------------------------

Let's call the following C function from COBOL:

     ---- say.c -----------------------------
     int say(char *hello, char *world)
     {
       int i;
       for(i = 0; i < 7; i++)
         putchar(hello[i]);
       for(i = 0; i < 6; i++)
         putchar(world[i]);
       putchar('\n');
       return 0;
     }
     ----------------------------------------

   This program is equivalent to the program in 'say.cob' above.

   Note that, unlike C, the arguments passed from COBOL programs are not
terminated by the null character (i.e., ''\0'').

   You can call this function in the same way you call COBOL programs:

     ---- hello.cob -------------------------
            IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
            PROGRAM-ID. hello.
            ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
            DATA DIVISION.
            WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
            01 hello PIC X(7) VALUE "Hello, ".
            01 world PIC X(6) VALUE "world!".
            PROCEDURE DIVISION.
            CALL "say" USING hello world.
            STOP RUN.
     ----------------------------------------

   Compile these programs as follows:

     $ cc -c say.c
     $ cobc -c -static -x hello.cob
     $ cobc -x -o hello hello.o say.o
     $ ./hello
     Hello, world!

2.3.5 Dynamic linking with C programs
-------------------------------------

You can create a dynamically-linked module from a C program by passing
an option '-shared' to the C compiler:

     $ cc -shared -o say.so say.c
     $ cobc -x hello.cob
     $ export COB_LIBRARY_PATH=.
     $ ./hello
     Hello, world!


File: gnucobol.info,  Node: Interface functions for C,  Prev: Dynamic COBOL to C,  Up: C interface

2.3.6 Redirecting output to a (FILE *)
--------------------------------------

From a module written in C you can call 'cob_set_runtime_option' to set
the exact '(FILE *)' which is used to write trace data to.  In
'common.h' is the following:
     enum cob_runtime_option_switch {
        COB_SET_RUNTIME_TRACE_FILE              /* 'p' is  FILE *  */
        COB_SET_RUNTIME_DISPLAY_PRINTER_FILE    /* 'p' is  FILE *  */
        COB_SET_RUNTIME_RESCAN_ENV              /* rescan environment variables */
        COB_SET_RUNTIME_DISPLAY_PUNCH_FILE      /* 'p' is  FILE *  */
     };
     COB_EXPIMP  void  cob_set_runtime_option   (enum cob_runtime_option_switch opt, void *p);

   So from you C code you can tell the GnuCOBOL runtime to redirect
TRACE output by:
     cob_set_runtime_option (COB_SET_RUNTIME_TRACE_FILE,
                             (void*)((FILE*)myfd));

   You could also redirect all 'DISPLAY UPON PRINTER' output to a file
by:
     cob_set_runtime_option (COB_SET_RUNTIME_DISPLAY_PRINTER_FILE,
                             (void*)((FILE*)myfd));

   You could also redirect all 'DISPLAY UPON SYSPUNCH' output to a file
by:
     cob_set_runtime_option (COB_SET_RUNTIME_DISPLAY_PUNCH_FILE,
                              (void*)((FILE*)myfd));

   Another routine can be used to return the current value of the
option.
     COB_EXPIMP  void *
     cob_get_runtime_option (enum cob_runtime_option_switch opt);

4.1 Optimize options
====================

There are five compiler options for optimization: '-O0', '-O', '-Os',
'-O2', '-O3'.  These options enable optimization at both translation
(from COBOL to C) and compilation (C to assembly) levels.

   Currently, there is no difference between these optimization options
at the translation level.

   The option '-O', '-Os' or '-O2' is passed to the C compiler as is and
used for C level optimization.

4.3 Optimize binary
===================

By default, data items of usage binary or comp are stored in big-endian
form.  On those machines whose native byte order is little-endian, this
is not quite efficient.

   If you prefer, you can store binary items in the native form of your
machine.  Set the config option 'binary-byteorder' to 'native' in your
config file (*note Customize::).

   In addition, setting the option 'binary-size' to '2-4-8' or '1-2-4-8'
is more efficient than others.

6.3 Extended ACCEPT statement
=============================

Extended 'ACCEPT' statements allow for full control of items accepted
from the screen.  Items accept by line and column positioning.

   All commands following 'WITH' are optional.

     ACCEPT VARIABLE-1
        LINE VARIABLE-2 | LITERAL-1 COLUMN VARIABLE-3 | LITERAL-2
        WITH
           AUTO-SKIP | AUTO
           BACKGROUND-COLOR VARIABLE-4 | LITERAL-3
           BELL | BEEP
           BLINK
           FOREGROUND-COLOR VARIABLE-5 | LITERAL-4
           LOWLIGHT | HIGHLIGHT
           PROMPT
           PROTECTED
           SIZE [IS] VARIABLE-6 | LITERAL-5
           UPDATE
        ON EXCEPTION
           EXCEPTION PROCESSING
        NOT ON EXCEPTION
           NORMAL PROCESSING
     END-ACCEPT.

6.3.1 LINE
----------

The line number of VARIABLE-2 or LITERAL-1 to accept the field.

6.3.2 COLUMN
------------

The column number of VARIABLE-3 or LITERAL-2 to accept the field.

6.3.3 AUTO-SKIP
---------------

The word 'AUTO' may be used for 'AUTO-SKIP'.

   With this option the 'ACCEPT' statement returns after the last
character is typed at the end of the field.  This is the same as if the
Enter key were pressed.

   Without this option the cursor remains at the end of the field and
waits for the user to press Enter.

   The Right-Arrow key returns from the end of the field.  The
Left-Arrow key returns from the beginning.  *Note Arrow keys: ACCEPT
special.

   The Alt-Right-Arrow and Alt-Left-Arrow keys never 'AUTO-SKIP'.

6.3.4 BACKGROUND-COLOR
----------------------

The background color is the color used behind the characters.

   VARIABLE-4 or LITERAL-3 must be numeric.  See file 'screenio.cpy' for
the color assignments to VARIABLE-4 or LITERAL-3.

6.3.5 BELL
----------

The word 'BEEP' may be used for 'BELL'.

   The system beeps when the cursor moves to accept from this field.  On
some systems, there is no sound.  Some other method may indicate a beep,
such a flashing screen or pop up window.

6.3.6 BLINK
-----------

The field blinks while the user enters the data.  This can help small
menu selection fields to stand out.

6.3.7 FOREGROUND-COLOR
----------------------

The foreground color is the color used for the characters.

   VARIABLE-5 or LITERAL-4 must be numeric.  See file 'screenio.cpy' for
the color assignments to VARIABLE-5 or LITERAL-4.

6.3.8 LOWLIGHT
--------------

The 'LOWLIGHT' and 'HIGHLIGHT' phrases vary the intensity of the field.

   'LOWLIGHT' displays with lower intensity and 'HIGHLIGHT' displays
with higher intensity.  Having neither 'LOWLIGHT' nor 'HIGHLIGHT'
displays at normal intensity.

   These may have different levels of intensity, if at all, depending on
the make and model of the screens.

6.3.9 PROMPT
------------

Display the field with prompt characters as the cursor moves to accept
from this field.

6.3.10 PROTECTED
----------------

'PROTECTED' is ignored.

6.3.11 SIZE
-----------

The size of VARIABLE-1 to accept from the screen.

   VARIABLE-6 or LITERAL-5 must be numeric.

'SIZE <greater than zero>'

     If VARIABLE-6 or LITERAL-5 is less than the length of VARIABLE-1
     then only the 'SIZE' number of characters accept into the field.
     VARIABLE-1 pads with spaces after 'SIZE' to the end of the field.

     If VARIABLE-6 or LITERAL-5 is greater than VARIABLE-1, then the
     screen pads with spaces after VARIABLE-1 to the 'SIZE' length.

'SIZE ZERO'
'<SIZE option not specified>'

     The VARIABLE-1 accepts to its field length.

6.3.12 UPDATE
-------------

The contents of variable-1 displays on the screen as the 'ACCEPT'
begins.  This allows the user to update the field without having to type
it all again.

   Without this option, the 'ACCEPT' field is always blank.

6.3.13 ON EXCEPTION
-------------------

Check the special register cob-crt-status for the special key that was
pressed.  This includes Escape, Tab, Back-Tab, F-keys, arrows, etc...
See screenio.cpy for the values.

6.3.14 NOT ON EXCEPTION
-----------------------

Reset any F-key indicator because no special key was pressed.


File: gnucobol.info,  Node: ACCEPT special,  Next: Extended DISPLAY,  Prev: Extended ACCEPT,  Up: Extensions

6.4 ACCEPT special keys
=======================

Special keys are available for extended 'ACCEPT' statements.

   The 'COB-CRT-STATUS' values are in the screenio.cpy copy file.

6.4.1 Arrow keys
----------------

The Left-Arrow key moves the cursor to the left.  Without 'AUTO-SKIP'
the cursor stops at the beginning of the field.  With 'AUTO-SKIP' it
returns with the 'COB-SCR-KEY-LEFT' value of 2009.  *Note AUTO-SKIP:
Extended ACCEPT.

   The Alt-Left-Arrow key is the same as Left-Arrow except that it never
returns, even for 'AUTO-SKIP'.

   The Right-Arrow key moves the cursor to the right.  Without
'AUTO-SKIP' the cursor stops at the end of the field.  With 'AUTO-SKIP'
it returns with the 'COB-SCR-KEY-RIGHT' value of 2010.  *Note AUTO-SKIP:
Extended ACCEPT.

   The Alt-Right-Arrow key is the same as Right-Arrow except that it
never returns, even for 'AUTO-SKIP'.

6.4.2 Backspace key
-------------------

The Backspace key moves the cursor, and the remainder of the text, to
the left.

6.4.3 Delete keys
-----------------

The Delete key deletes the cursor's character and moves the remainder of
the text to the left.  The cursor does not move.

   The Alt-Delete key deletes all text from the cursor to the end of the
field.

6.4.4 End key
-------------

The End key moves the cursor after the last non-space character.
Pressing the End key again moves the cursor to the end of the field.
Repeated pressing moves the cursor back and forth.

6.4.5 Home key
--------------

The Home key moves the cursor to the first non-space character.
Pressing the Home key again moves the cursor to the beginning of the
field.  Repeated pressing moves the cursor back and forth.

6.4.6 Insert key
----------------

The Insert key changes the insert mode.

   The value of the insert mode is used in all following 'ACCEPT'
statements while the program is running.

   When the insert mode is on, typed characters move the existing
characters to the right until field is full.  When it is off, typed
characters type over existing characters.

   Note: The insert mode is ignored for fields with a size of 1.

   The insert mode can also be changed by the 'COB_INSERT_MODE' setting
at any time, *note Runtime Configuration: Appendix H.

6.4.7 Tab keys
--------------

The Tab key returns from the 'ACCEPT' with the 'COB-SCR-TAB' value of
2007.

   The Shift-Tab key returns with the 'COB-SCR-BACK-TAB' value of 2008.

6.5 Extended DISPLAY statement
==============================

Extended 'DISPLAY' statements allow for full control of items that
display on the screen.  Items display by line and column positioning.


     DISPLAY VARIABLE-1 | LITERAL-1 | FIGURATIVE CONSTANT
        LINE LINE COLUMN COLUMN
        WITH BELL
             BLANK LINE | SCREEN
             ERASE EOL | EOS
             SIZE [IS] VARIABLE-2 | LITERAL-2
     END-DISPLAY.


6.5.1 BELL
----------

Ring the bell.  It is optional.

6.5.2 BLANK
-----------

Clear the whole line or screen.  It is optional.

'BLANK LINE'

     Clear the line from the beginning of the line to the end of the
     line.

'BLANK SCREEN'

     Clear the whole screen.

6.5.3 ERASE
-----------

Clear the line or screen from LINE and COLUMN. It is optional.

'ERASE EOL'

     Clear the line from LINE and COLUMN to the end of the line.

'ERASE EOS'

     Clear the screen from LINE and COLUMN to the end of the screen.

6.5.4 SIZE
----------

The size of VARIABLE-1, LITERAL-1, or FIGURATIVE-CONSTANT to display
onto the screen.  It is optional.

'SIZE POSITIVE-INTEGER'

     If 'SIZE' is less than the length of VARIABLE-1 or LITERAL-1 then
     only the 'SIZE' number of characters display.

     If 'SIZE' is greater than the length of VARIABLE-1 or LITERAL-1,
     then the screen pads with spaces after the field to the 'SIZE'
     length.

     Figurative constants display repeatedly the number of times in
     'SIZE'.  Except that 'LOW-VALUES' always positions the cursor (see
     'SIZE' ZERO below).

'SIZE ZERO'
'<SIZE option not specified>'

     VARIABLE-1 or LITERAL-1 displays with the field length.

6.5.5 Figurative Constants
--------------------------

Certain figurative constants and values have special functions.  All
other figurative constants display as a single character.

'SPACE'
     Display spaces from LINE and COLUMN to the end of the screen.  This
     is the same as WITH ERASE EOS.

'LOW-VALUE'
     Position the cursor to LINE and COLUMN. The next 'DISPLAY'
     statement does not need a LINE or COLUMN to display at that
     position.

'ALL X"01"'
     Display spaces from LINE and COLUMN to the end of the line.  This
     is the same as 'WITH ERASE EOL'.

'ALL X"02"'
     Clear the whole screen.  This is the same as 'WITH BLANK SCREEN'.

'ALL X"07"'
     Ring the bell.  This is the same as 'WITH BELL'.

File: gnucobol.info,  Node: CBL_GC_GETOPT,  Next: CBL_GC_HOSTED,  Up: System Routines

7.1 CBL_GC_GETOPT
=================

'CBL_GC_GETOPT' provides the quite well-known option parser, getopt, for
GnuCOBOL. The usage of this system routine is described by the following
example.

             identification division.
             program-id. prog.

             data division.
             working-storage section.
                 78 shortoptions value "jkl".

                 01 longoptions.
                     05 optionrecord occurs 2 times.
                         10 optionname   pic x(25).
                         10 has-value    pic 9.
                         10 valpoint     pointer value NULL.
                         10 return-value pic x(4).

                 01 longind     pic 99.
                 01 long-only   pic 9 value 1.

                 01 return-char pic x(4).
                 01 opt-val     pic x(10).

                 01 counter     pic 9 value 0.

   We first need to define the necessary fields for getopt's
shortoptions (so), longoptions (lo), longoption index (longind),
long-only-option (long-only) and also the fields for return values
return-char and opt-val (arbitrary size with trimming, see return
codes).

   The shortoptions are written down as an alphanumeric field (i.e., a
string with arbitrary size) as follows:

     "ab:c::d"

   This means we want getopt to look for shortoptions named a, b, c or d
and we demand an option value for b and we are accepting an optional one
for c.

   The longoptions are defined as a table of records with oname,
has-value, valpoint and val.
   * oname defines the name of a longoption.
   * has-value defines if an option value is demanded (has-val = 1),
     optional (has-val = 2) or not required (has-val = 0).
   * valpoint is a pointer used to specify an address to save getopt's
     return value to.  The pointer is optional.  If it is 'NULL', getopt
     returns a value as usual.  If you use the pointer it has to point
     to a 'PIC X(4)' field.
   * The field val is a 'PIC X(4)' character which is returned if the
     longoption was recognized.
   The longoption structure is immutable!  You can only vary the number
of records.

   Now we have the tools to run 'CBL_GC_GETOPT' within the procedure
division.

             procedure division.
                 move "version" to optionname   (1).
                 move 0         to has-value    (1).
                 move "v"       to return-value (1).

                 move "verbose" to optionname   (2).
                 move 0         to has-value    (2).
                 move "V"       to return-value (2).

                 perform with test after until return-code = -1
                     call 'CBL_GC_GETOPT' using
                        by reference shortoptions longoptions longind
                        by value long-only
                        by reference return-char opt-val
                     end-call

                     display return-char end-display
                     display opt-val     end-display
                 end-perform
                 stop run.


   The example shows how we initialize all parameters and call the
routine until 'CBL_GC_GETOPT' runs out of options and returns -1.

   If the option is recognized, 'return-char' contains the option
character.  Otherwise, 'return-char' will contain one of the following:
'?'
     undefined or ambiguous option
'1'
     non-option (only if first byte of so is '-')
'0'
     'valpoint != NULL' and we are writing the return value to the
     specified address
'-1'
     no more options (or reached the first non-option if first byte of
     so is '+')

The return-code of 'CBL_GC_GETOPT' is one of:

'1'
     a non-option (only if first byte of so is '-')
'0'
     'valpoint != NULL' and we are writing the return value to the
     specified address
'-1'
     no more options (or reach the first non-option if first byte of so
     is '+')
'2'
     truncated option value in opt-val (because opt-val was too small)
'3'
     regular answer from 'getopt'

7.2 CBL_GC_HOSTED
=================

'CBL_GC_HOSTED' provides access to the following C hosted variables:
   * 'argc'  to binary-long by value
   * 'argv'  to pointer to char **
   * 'stdin', 'stdout', 'stderr'  to pointer
   * 'errno'  giving address of errno in pointer to binary-long, use
     based for more direct access

   and conditional access to the following variables:
   * 'tzname'  pointer to pointer to array of two char pointers
   * 'timezone'  C long, will be seconds west of UTC
   * 'daylight'  C int, will be 1 during daylight savings

   System will need to 'HAVE_TIMEZONE' defined for these to return
anything meaningful.  Attempts made when they are not available return 1
from 'CBL_GC_HOSTED'.

   It returns 0 when match, 1 on failure, case matters as does length,
'arg' won't match.

   The usage of this system routine is described by the following
example.

     HOSTED identification division.
            program-id. hosted.
            data division.

7.3 CBL_GC_NANOSLEEP
====================

'CBL_GC_NANOSLEEP' allows you to pause the program for nanoseconds.  The
actual precision depends on the system.

7.4 CBL_GC_FORK
===============

'CBL_GC_FORK' allows you to fork the current COBOL process to a new one.
The current content of the process' storage (including 'LOCAL-STORAGE')
will be identical, any file handles get invalid in the new process,
positions and file / record locks are only available to the original
process.

   This system routine is not available on Windows (exception: GCC on
Cygwin).

Parameters
     none

Returns
     PID (the child process gets '0' returned, the calling process gets
     the PID of the created children).  Negative values are returned for
     system dependent error codes and -1 if the function is not
     available on the current system.

Appendix H Runtime configuration
********************************

The following list was extracted from 'config/runtime.cfg'.

H.1 General instructions
========================

The initial 'runtime.cfg' file is found in the '$COB_CONFIG_DIR' , which
defaults to installdir/gnucobol/config (see 'cobcrun --info' for the
local path that is configured).  The environment variable
'COB_RUNTIME_CONFIG' may define a different runtime configuration file
to read.

   If settings are included in the runtime environment file multiple
times then the last setting value is used, no warning occurs.

   Settings via environment variables always take precedence over
settings that are given in runtime configuration files.  And the
environment is checked after completing processing of the runtime
configuration file(s)

   All values set to string variables or environment variables are
checked for ${envvar} and replacement is done at the time of the
setting.  You can also specify a default value for the case that envvar
is not set: '${envvar:default}' (the format '${envvar:-default}' is
supported, too).

   Any environment variable may be set with the directive 'setenv' .
Example
     'setenv COB_LIBARAY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}'

   Any environment variable may be unset with the directive 'unsetenv'
(one var per line).
Example
     'unsetenv COB_LIBRARY_PATH'

   Runtime configuration files can 'include 'other files with the
directive 'include ' .
Example
     'include my-runtime-configuration-file'

   To 'include 'another configuration file only if it is present use the
directive 'includeif' .  You can also use ${envvar} inside this.
Example
     'includeif ${HOME}/mygc.cfg'

   If you want to reset a parameter to its default value use 'reset
parametername' .

   Most runtime variables have boolean values, some are switches, some
have string values, integer values (if not explicit noted: unsigned) and
some are size values.  The boolean values will be evaluated as
following: to true:	'1', 'Y', O'N', 'YES', 'TRUE' (no matter of case) to
false:	'0', 'N', 'OFF'.

   A 'size' value is an unsigned integer optionally followed by 'K',
'M', or 'G' for 'kilo', 'mega' or 'giga'.

   For convenience a parameter in the 'runtime.cfg' file may be defined
by using either the environment variable name or the parameter name.  In
most cases the environment variable name is the parameter name (in upper
case) with the prefix 'COB_' .

   For a complete list of the settings in use see 'cobcrun
--runtime-config' .

   Note: If you want to slightly speed up a program's startup time,
remove all of the comments from the actual real configuration file that
is processed.

         Purpose:  specify which mouse events will be sent as function key
                   to the application during ACCEPT and how they will be
                   handled
            Type:  int (by bits)
         Default:  1
            Note:  0 disables the mouse cursor, any other value enables it,
                   any value containing 1 will enable internal handling (click
                   to position, double-click to enter).

  Parameter name:  display_print_pipe
         Purpose:  Defines command line used for sending output of
                   DISPLAY UPON PRINTER to (via pipe)
                   This is very similar to Micro Focus COBPRINTER
            Note:  Each executed DISPLAY UPON PRINTER statement causes a
                   new invocation of command-line (= new process start).
                   Each invocation receives the data referenced in
                   the DISPLAY statement and is followed by an
                   end-of-file condition.
                   COB_DISPLAY_PRINT_FILE, if set, takes precedence
                   over COB_DISPLAY_PRINT_PIPE.

            Type:  string       : $$ is replaced by process id
         Default:  not set
         Example:  display_printer '/tmp/myprt.log'

Environment name:  COB_DISPLAY_PUNCH_FILE
  Parameter name:  display_punch_file
         Purpose:  Defines file to be created on first
                   DISPLAY UPON SYSPUNCH/SYSPCH
            Note:  The file will be only be closed on runtime exit.
            Type:  string       : $$ is replaced by process id

            Type:  string
         Default:  'end of program, please press a key to exit' (localized)
         Example:  COB_EXIT_MSG ''



H.5 Report I/O
==============



Environment name:  COB_COL_JUST_LRC
  Parameter name:  col_just_lrc
         Purpose:  If true, then COLUMN defined as LEFT, RIGHT or CENTER
                   will have the data justified within the field limits
                   If false, then the data is just copied into the column as is
            Type:  boolean

     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the

     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
